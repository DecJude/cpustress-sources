1. In most cases you can just use one of the precompiled binaries.

2. To compile, copy one of the makefiles to 'Makefile', and 
   issue 'make' to create the stresscpu2 binary.

3. If you can't get threads to work at all, you can disable them with -DNO_THREADS.
   It works just fine to run multiple copies of the program in parallel instead.

4. There is no 64 bit windows binary since I'm not going to go through the effort to 
   buy & install a 64 bit windows system just to test this program and then throw it
   out again. Complain to Microsoft :-) 
   I've created a 64-bit kernel assembly file for masm, but there are likely a couple of
   typos remaining in it. If you have access to a ml64.exe (64-bit masm) you could do me
   a favor by trying to compile kernel_x86_64_masm_syntax.s and send me the error listing.

Have fun,
